# =========================================================================
# THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE DATABASE FILE SHOULD LOOK LIKE 
#
# 1. Before you start developing, create another file called 'database.yml'
#
# 2. Fill up that file with the same contents as this file
#
# 3. Fill in the missing information.
#
#==========================================================================
#
# SQLite version 3.x
#   gem install sqlite3
#
#   Ensure the SQLite 3 gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem 'sqlite3'
#
default: &default
  adapter: sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

development:
    # <<: *default
    # database: db/development.sqlite3
  adapter: mysql
  database: nuscomputing_main
  username: # your local database account username
  password: # your local database account password
  host: localhost

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: db/test.sqlite3

production:
    # <<: *default
    # database: db/production.sqlite3
  adapter: mysql
  database: nuscomputing_main
