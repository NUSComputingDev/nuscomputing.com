      The NUS Studentsâ€™ Computing Club, commonly known as CompClub, is a

      undergraduates in NUS School of Computing and works together with
      different organizations to cater to the members' different needs and
      wants. CompClub strives to be the bridge between its members and the
      staff in the School of Computing, facilitating new initiatives by the
      school and channeling the feedback from its members to the right office.
