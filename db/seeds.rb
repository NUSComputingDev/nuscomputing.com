Here was born the idea of textbook rental, allowing students to save up to 70% off on their required course materials ­ saving students hundreds and even thousands of dollars throughout their degree.

      Having started the company to positively impact the lives of university students and quickly grown to serve hundreds of thousands of students in Australia, the founders have now dreamed of even bigger goals — leveraging technology to enhance the modern university experience for students. Zookal’s new video platform will allow university students thorughout Asia to share knowledge and discover the supplementary educational resources they need to learn faster and be more successful."
